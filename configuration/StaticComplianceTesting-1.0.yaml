      summary: Check the API by passing the spec as a multi-part file (simple file upload)
      description: It allows you to pass the definition of the swagger file to be checked against the reference definition. The SCTK will extract based on the API Key supplied the catalog name and the API identifier. It will also use the version from within the supplied 'swaggerFile' to match the corresponding version from the catalogue history. After the compliance check was performed it will respond back with a JSON object containing the results.
